## Key Concepts

### Auto-Generated Files
The `work/projects.json` file is automatically generated by the `generate-projects.js` script and should not be edited manually. It's also git-ignored to avoid committing large image references.

### Neomorphic Design
The portfolio uses a neomorphic design style with soft shadows and embossed elements. Color customization can be done via CSS variables in `styles.css`.

### Profile Picture
Replace `profile.jpg` in the root directory with your own profile picture to personalize the portfolio.
